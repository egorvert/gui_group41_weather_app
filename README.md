# GUI Group 41 Weather App for Climbers

## Overview
Our weather app is designed by climbers, for climbers. Our goal is to make a tailored weather app for any and all outdoor climbers that no other app can replace.

The most notable features of our application include:
- Safety indicator based on current and previous weather conditions such as moisture, humidity and temperature
- At a glance sunrise and sunset times so that climbers can plan their ascents around sunlight hours
- Hourly forecast showing potential changes and dangers later in the day
